Fluorescence was measured by fluorometric reader with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. The HDAC activity was expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU).",B,,,BAO_0000190,BAO_0000357,single protein format,C[C@H]1C=C2C=C[C@H](C)[C@H](CC[C@@H]3C[C@@H](O[Si](C)(C)C(C)(C)C)CC(=O)O3)[C@H]2[C@@H](OC(=O)NCCCCCCC(=O)NO)C1,,,CHEMBL3639013,,2015.0,"{'bei': '11.04', 'le': None, 'lle': None, 'sei': None}",CHEMBL2347005,,CHEMBL2347005,6.86,0,http://www.openphacts.org/units/Nanomolar,2582464,=,37,1,=,,IC50,nM,,139.7,CHEMBL1865,Homo sapiens,Histone deacetylase 6,9606,,,IC50,nM,UO_0000065,,139.7

The kit is a highly sensitive and convenient alternative to radiolabeled, acetylated histones or peptide/HPLC methods for the assay of histone deacetylases. This assay is based on the ability of HeLa nuclear extract, which is enriched in HDAC activity, to mediate the deacetylation of the acetylated lysine side chain of the Fluor de Lys substrate. The assay procedure requires two steps. First, incubation of the HeLa nuclear extract with the Fluor de Lys substrate results in substrate deacetylation and thus sensitizes it to the second step. In the second step, treatment of the deacetylated substrate with the Fluor de Lys developer produces a fluorophore.
